# TSF_GRIP_June2021_DSBA_Task1
This is the Task 1 I did in my time as Data Science &amp; Business Analytics Intern in The Spark Foundation GRIP program in June 2021. 
This task consists of prediction using supervised machine learning model (Linear Regression). 
In this task, we need to predict the percentage scored by a student on the basis of the number of hours they studied per day. 
Specifically, what would be the predicted percentage of a student who studies for 9.25 hrs per day.
